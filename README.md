# To-Do List Application in C++

This is a simple command-line To-Do list application implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, marking as completed, and viewing tasks. It also supports saving and loading tasks from a file, ensuring that your tasks persist between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with descriptions.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed, visually indicating their status.
- **View Tasks**: Users can view all tasks along with their completion status.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) and loaded when the application starts, allowing for persistent task management.
